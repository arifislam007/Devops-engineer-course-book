# **Chapter 4: Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**

## **Introduction to Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**

Infrastructure as Code (IaC) is a key concept in DevOps that allows you to manage and provision infrastructure through code rather than manual processes. With IaC, infrastructure components such as servers, networks, storage, and databases can be defined in configuration files, enabling automated provisioning, scaling, and management.

The main benefits of IaC include:
- **Consistency**: Infrastructure setup is consistent across all environments (development, staging, production).
- **Automation**: Reduces human intervention, leading to faster and more reliable deployments.
- **Scalability**: Easily scale infrastructure resources up or down with simple code changes.
- **Versioning**: Infrastructure configurations are stored in version control systems like Git, providing better change tracking and rollback capabilities.
  
In this chapter, we’ll cover two powerful tools for implementing IaC: **Terraform** for provisioning infrastructure and **Ansible** for configuration management. Together, these tools enable you to automate infrastructure setup, deployment, and configuration.

## **Terraform for Automated Provisioning**

### **What is Terraform?**

Terraform is an open-source IaC tool that allows you to define and manage infrastructure resources in a cloud environment using declarative configuration files. It supports multiple cloud providers such as AWS, Azure, Google Cloud, and others. Terraform allows you to define the desired state of your infrastructure in configuration files, and then it automatically manages and provisions resources based on these configurations.

Terraform follows the **Infrastructure as Code** paradigm by using configuration files written in **HashiCorp Configuration Language (HCL)**. It allows you to specify resources like virtual machines, networks, databases, and other infrastructure components.

### **Core Concepts in Terraform**

1. **Providers**: Providers are responsible for managing the lifecycle of resources. Each cloud provider (like AWS or Azure) has its own provider in Terraform.
2. **Resources**: Resources are the components that Terraform manages, such as EC2 instances, storage buckets, VPCs, and security groups.
3. **State**: Terraform maintains an internal state file (`terraform.tfstate`) that tracks the current state of the infrastructure.
4. **Modules**: Modules are reusable configurations that can be shared across different projects or environments.
5. **Terraform Plan**: Before applying changes, Terraform generates a plan to show what changes will be made to the infrastructure.

### **Setting Up Terraform**

1. **Install Terraform**: First, install Terraform by downloading it from [Terraform's official website](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html) and following the installation instructions for your operating system.
   
2. **Configure AWS Provider**:
   To use Terraform with AWS, you need to configure your AWS credentials using the AWS CLI or by setting environment variables.

   ```bash
   aws configure
   ```

   Alternatively, you can specify your credentials in the Terraform configuration file.

3. **Terraform Configuration Example**:
   
   Here’s an example Terraform configuration file (`main.tf`) that provisions an AWS EC2 instance:

   ```hcl
   provider "aws" {
     region = "us-west-2"
   }

   resource "aws_instance" "my_instance" {
     ami           = "ami-0c55b159cbfafe1f0"
     instance_type = "t2.micro"
   }
   ```

   - `provider`: Specifies the cloud provider (in this case, AWS).
   - `resource`: Defines the EC2 instance resource and its attributes, such as `ami` (Amazon Machine Image) and `instance_type`.

4. **Running Terraform**:
   - Initialize the Terraform configuration:
     ```bash
     terraform init
     ```
   - Generate an execution plan:
     ```bash
     terraform plan
     ```
   - Apply the changes to create the EC2 instance:
     ```bash
     terraform apply
     ```

   This will provision an EC2 instance on AWS according to the configuration file.

### **Terraform Workflows**

The typical Terraform workflow consists of the following steps:

1. **Write**: Define the desired infrastructure state in `.tf` configuration files.
2. **Plan**: Terraform generates a plan of what will be created, modified, or destroyed.
3. **Apply**: Terraform applies the plan and provisions the infrastructure.
4. **Destroy**: Terraform can also destroy the infrastructure when it's no longer needed:
   ```bash
   terraform destroy
   ```

### **Best Practices for Terraform**

1. **Use Modules**: Break your configurations into reusable modules for better organization.
2. **Version Control**: Store your Terraform configuration files in a version control system like Git to track changes.
3. **State Management**: Use remote backends (e.g., AWS S3) to store the state file to enable collaboration and prevent state file conflicts.
4. **Validate and Format**: Use `terraform validate` to check for errors in your configuration and `terraform fmt` to format the code according to best practices.

## **Ansible for Configuration Management**

### **What is Ansible?**

Ansible is an open-source configuration management tool that automates tasks such as software provisioning, configuration management, and application deployment. Unlike Terraform, which is focused on provisioning infrastructure, Ansible is used to configure and manage the systems that run on that infrastructure.

Ansible uses **playbooks**, which are YAML files that describe the tasks to be performed on a set of machines. Ansible uses an agentless architecture, meaning it doesn’t require any special agent software to be installed on the target machines. Instead, it uses SSH (or WinRM for Windows) to communicate with the target servers.

### **Core Concepts in Ansible**

1. **Playbooks**: A playbook is a YAML file that defines a series of tasks that Ansible will perform on remote machines.
2. **Modules**: Ansible uses modules to perform specific tasks, such as installing packages, managing services, or copying files.
3. **Inventories**: An inventory is a file that lists the hosts that Ansible will manage.
4. **Roles**: Roles are a way to organize playbooks into reusable components.
5. **Handlers**: Handlers are tasks that run when notified by other tasks.

### **Setting Up Ansible**

1. **Install Ansible**:
   Ansible can be installed on Linux or macOS using package managers. On Ubuntu, you can install Ansible with:

   ```bash
   sudo apt-get install ansible
   ```

2. **Creating an Inventory**:
   An inventory file (`inventory.ini`) specifies the hosts that Ansible will manage. For example:

   ```ini
   [web_servers]
   server1.example.com
   server2.example.com

   [db_servers]
   db1.example.com
   ```

3. **Writing a Playbook**:
   A basic playbook for installing Apache on a remote server might look like this:

   ```yaml
   ---
   - name: Install Apache
     hosts: web_servers
     become: yes
     tasks:
       - name: Install Apache HTTPD
         apt:
           name: apache2
           state: present

       - name: Start Apache service
         service:
           name: apache2
           state: started
   ```

4. **Running the Playbook**:
   You can execute the playbook using the following command:

   ```bash
   ansible-playbook -i inventory.ini install_apache.yml
   ```

### **Ansible Roles and Best Practices**

1. **Roles**: Ansible roles allow you to organize your playbooks and tasks in a structured way. A role might include tasks for installing software, configuring files, and setting up services.
   
   A typical Ansible role structure looks like this:
   ```
   roles/
     ├── apache/
     │   ├── tasks/
     │   ├── handlers/
     │   └── templates/
   ```

2. **Idempotence**: Ansible ensures that running the same playbook multiple times produces the same result. If a task has already been completed, it will be skipped in subsequent runs.

3. **Use Variables**: Use variables in Ansible to make your playbooks more dynamic and reusable.

## **Hands-on Exercise**

### **Exercise 1: Terraform Provisioning**

1. Use Terraform to provision a basic EC2 instance on AWS.
2. Configure security groups and IAM roles to manage access.
3. Modify the configuration to use an Amazon Machine Image (AMI) of your choice.

### **Exercise 2: Ansible Configuration Management**

1. Write an Ansible playbook to install Apache on a set of remote servers.
2. Use Ansible to configure Apache to serve a simple HTML page.
3. Run the playbook on multiple servers.
