**About the Course Structure**

The course is divided into four major learning paths:

- **Linux Foundations**: Understanding Linux is something that lies at the heart of a DevOps engineer's profession. This track will take you from basic system administration all the way up through scripting and networking.

You will learn how to provision and manage AWS services, build scalable solutions, and protect your cloud infrastructure. You will also get hands-on experience with features such as EC2, S3, RDS, Lambda, VPC, and many more.

- **DevOps Practices**: DevOps is all about automating the workflow and continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD). Here we will be covering the tools and practices that support a DevOps culture such as version control, containerization, orchestration with Kubernetes, CI/CD pipelines, and Infrastructure as Code (IaC).

- **Freelancing Marketplace Strategies**: Beyond technical skills, the modern DevOps engineer will need to figure out how to market themselves. This stream focuses on building a professional portfolio, optimizing freelancing profiles, delivering great client communication, and personal branding.
