# **Chapter 5: AWS Database Services**  

## **5.1 Introduction to AWS Database Services**  
AWS offers a wide range of **fully managed database services** designed for different use cases, including **relational, NoSQL, and in-memory databases**. These services help businesses store, manage, and scale their data efficiently.  

### **Key AWS Database Services Covered in This Chapter**  
✔ **Amazon RDS (Relational Database Service):** Managed relational databases like MySQL, PostgreSQL, and MariaDB.  
✔ **Amazon DynamoDB:** A serverless, NoSQL database designed for high-speed, low-latency applications.  
✔ **Amazon ElastiCache:** In-memory caching service for improving application performance.  
✔ **Database Migration Service (AWS DMS):** Helps migrate databases from on-premises to AWS cloud.

## **5.2 Amazon RDS (Relational Database Service)**  
### **What is Amazon RDS?**  
Amazon RDS is a **fully managed relational database service** that automates database tasks like provisioning, backups, scaling, and maintenance.  

### **Supported Database Engines**  
- MySQL  
- PostgreSQL  
- MariaDB  
- Microsoft SQL Server  
- Oracle  
- Amazon Aurora (AWS-native database)  

### **Key Features of RDS**  
✔ **Automated Backups & Snapshots** – Ensures data safety.  
✔ **Multi-AZ Deployments** – High availability and failover support.  
✔ **Read Replicas** – Scale read operations across multiple instances.  
✔ **Performance Monitoring** – Integrated with CloudWatch for insights.  
✔ **Security** – IAM-based access, encryption, and VPC isolation.  

### **Hands-on: Launching an RDS Instance**  
#### **Step 1: Create an RDS Instance**  
1. Open the **AWS Management Console** → Go to **RDS**.  
2. Click **Create Database** → Select **Standard Create**.  
3. Choose **Database Engine** (e.g., MySQL).  
4. Select **Instance Class** (e.g., `db.t3.micro` for free tier).  
5. Configure **Username & Password** → Set **Storage** to `20GB`.  
6. Enable **Multi-AZ Deployment** (for production environments).  
7. Click **Create Database** and wait for provisioning.  

#### **Step 2: Connect to RDS from an EC2 Instance**  
1. SSH into your **EC2 instance** and install MySQL client:  
   ```sh
   sudo apt update && sudo apt install mysql-client -y
   ```  
2. Connect to the RDS instance:  
   ```sh
   mysql -h mydb-instance.abcdefg.rds.amazonaws.com -u admin -p
   ```  
✔ **Outcome:** You are now connected to your RDS database!

## **5.3 Amazon DynamoDB – NoSQL Key-Value Store**  
### **What is DynamoDB?**  
Amazon DynamoDB is a **serverless NoSQL database** designed for high-speed applications. It provides **millisecond latency** and **scales automatically** based on demand.  

### **Key Features**  
✔ **Fully Managed:** No need for manual provisioning or scaling.  
✔ **High Availability:** Replicates data across multiple AWS regions.  
✔ **Automatic Scaling:** Adapts to workload fluctuations.  
✔ **Flexible Schema:** Supports key-value and document-based data.  

### **Hands-on: Creating a DynamoDB Table**  
#### **Step 1: Create a Table in DynamoDB**  
1. Open **AWS Console** → Go to **DynamoDB**.  
2. Click **Create Table** → Enter Table Name (`Users`).  
3. Define a **Primary Key** (`UserID`, type: String).  
4. Choose **On-Demand Mode** (for automatic scaling).  
5. Click **Create Table**.  

#### **Step 2: Insert and Query Data**  
- Insert an item into DynamoDB:  
   ```sh
   aws dynamodb put-item \
     --table-name Users \
     --item '{"UserID": {"S": "123"}, "Name": {"S": "John Doe"}, "Age": {"N": "30"}}'
   ```  
- Retrieve the data:  
   ```sh
   aws dynamodb get-item --table-name Users --key '{"UserID": {"S": "123"}}'
   ```  

✔ **Outcome:** Data is stored and retrieved using AWS CLI.

## **5.4 Amazon ElastiCache – In-Memory Data Store**  
### **What is ElastiCache?**  
Amazon ElastiCache is a **fully managed caching service** that improves application performance by **storing frequently accessed data** in memory. It supports:  
- **Redis:** High-performance caching and session storage.  
- **Memcached:** Distributed cache for high-throughput applications.  

### **Key Features**  
✔ **Microsecond Latency:** Faster than disk-based databases.  
✔ **Scalability:** Supports clustering and auto-scaling.  
✔ **Persistence:** Option to back up cached data.  

### **Hands-on: Setting Up an ElastiCache Cluster (Redis)**  
#### **Step 1: Create an ElastiCache Cluster**  
1. Open **AWS Console** → Go to **ElastiCache**.  
2. Click **Create Cluster** → Choose **Redis**.  
3. Select **Cluster Mode Enabled** (for scalability).  
4. Choose **Node Type** (`cache.t2.micro` for free tier).  
5. Click **Create Cluster** and wait for setup.  

#### **Step 2: Connect to ElastiCache from EC2**  
1. Install Redis CLI on EC2:  
   ```sh
   sudo apt update && sudo apt install redis-tools -y
   ```  
2. Connect to ElastiCache cluster:  
   ```sh
   redis-cli -h myredis-cluster.abcdefg.cache.amazonaws.com -p 6379
   ```  
3. Store and retrieve a value:  
   ```sh
   SET username "AWS_DevOps"
   GET username
   ```  

✔ **Outcome:** Redis is now running as an ultra-fast caching layer!

## **5.5 AWS Database Migration Service (AWS DMS)**  
### **What is AWS DMS?**  
AWS Database Migration Service (DMS) helps **migrate on-premises databases** to AWS with minimal downtime.  

### **Supported Migrations**  
✔ **Homogeneous Migration:** (e.g., MySQL → MySQL).  
✔ **Heterogeneous Migration:** (e.g., SQL Server → PostgreSQL).  
✔ **Data Replication:** Keeps databases in sync during migration.  

### **Hands-on: Migrating a MySQL Database to AWS RDS**  
#### **Step 1: Set Up AWS DMS**  
1. Open **AWS Console** → Go to **DMS**.  
2. Create a **Replication Instance**.  
3. Define **Source Database** (e.g., On-prem MySQL).  
4. Define **Target Database** (e.g., RDS MySQL).  
5. Create a **Migration Task** and start replication.  

✔ **Outcome:** Database is successfully migrated to AWS with minimal downtime.
